1. how should multiple textures be dealt with? (2 rows/hz are currently returned)
-- can this be fixed in SQL ?
--> NASIS: we are keeping only the first record
--> PedonPC: texture class is ommited from query

2. how should A/B horizons be dealt with when entered as 2 horizons sharing the same depths?

3. soil texture plotting / subsetting / flagging helper function or guidance

4. finish NASIS component queries and return similar objects as pedon queries

5. best-guess record from taxhistory table-- see fetchPedonPC() for current implementation

7. synchronize NASIS ---> PedonPC functions

8. need to check for presence of STD coordinates vs. DMS/datum coordinates, maybe warn users

9. figure out data problems: total_frags_pct vs. fragvoltot

10. remove getHzErrorsNASIS() and pedonPC equiv.
