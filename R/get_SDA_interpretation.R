#' Get map unit interpretations from Soil Data Access by rule name
#'
#' @param rulename character vector of interpretation rule names (matching `mrulename` in `cointerp` table)
#' @param method aggregation method. One of: "Dominant Component", "Dominant Condition", "Weighted Average", "None". If "None" is selected one row will be returned per component, otherwise one row will be returned per map unit.
#' @param areasymbols vector of soil survey area symbols
#' @param mukeys vector of map unit keys
#' @param WHERE character containing SQL WHERE clause specified in terms of fields in `legend`, `mapunit`, or `component` tables, used in lieu of `mukeys` or `areasymbols`
#' @param query_string Default: `FALSE`; if `TRUE` return a character string containing query that would be sent to SDA via `SDA_query`
#' @param not_rated_value used where rating class is "Not Rated". Default: `NA_real`
#' @param dsn Path to local SQLite database or a DBIConnection object. If `NULL` (default) use Soil Data Access API via `SDA_query()`.
