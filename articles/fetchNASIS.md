# fetchNASIS(from='pedons') Columns

This guide identifies source tables and columns for each column in the
`fetchNASIS(from='pedons')` result. Many data elements have a 1:1
relationship with a table and column in NASIS, these are described in
order of alphabetical order of their parent NASIS table.

The parent table physical name, column physical name and column
description are reported from the NASIS 7 metadata. Any columns that
deviate from the NASIS naming, but are 1:1 with a NASIS column, are
flagged `Alias="Yes"` and have a different
[`fetchNASIS()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/reference/fetchNASIS.md)
column name from the physical column name. In the future these will be
changed to match the NASIS metadata.

The final set of columns reported in this guide are “calculated”: these
are derived from data in NASIS and queries of child tables of
site/pedon/horizon, but do not have an analog or corresponding metadata
description in NASIS. These column entries have custom descriptions and
mention the soilDB functions responsible for generating them.

## `ecologicalsite`

The Ecological Site table records the official list of range and forest
ecological sites maintained by NRCS and described in the Ecosystem
Dynamics Interpretive Tool (EDIT). This table records only the
identifier and name of an ecological site. The complete ecological site
characterization resides in the EDIT database. The official list of
ecological sites is maintained in EDIT.

## `pedon`

profile description is made. It has data that relates to the profile as
a whole.

## `petaxhistmoistcl`

The Pedon Taxonomic History Moisture Class table provides clear
identification of the intended taxonomic moisture class, even though
moisture class is implied at a higher taxonomic level. The class or
classes listed in this table describe the representative situation for
the pedon.

## `petaxhistory`

This table records the taxonomic classification history of a pedon
record from the time it is first described and classified in the field
and throughout the life of the data record.

## `phorizon`

The Pedon Horizon table lists the horizons for each pedon. If the
horizon thickness is greater than zero (low=5, RV=8, high=12), the
horizon exists throughout the exposure of the profile. If the horizon
thickness includes zero (low=0, RV=1, high=3), the horizon may exist in
some places, but may not exist in other places.

Horizons that have two distinct parts, such as E/B or E&Bt, are recorded
twice. Once for the characteristics of the first part; and again on
another row, using the same depths and thicknesses, for the
characteristics of the other part.

horizon description and other types of data that may be in the database
that relate to that specific horizon, i.e. laboratory analysis results.

## `phtexture`

The Horizon Texture table lists the texture, or terms in lieu of
texture, for the texture modifier and class shown above in the Pedon
Horizon table. Only the unmodified texture term is listed in the Pedon
Horizon Texture table; modifiers are listed in the Pedon Horizon Texture
Modifier table. For example, a gravelly loamy sand is shown as “GR-LS”
in the Pedon Horizon table, “ls” in this table, and “gr” in the Pedon
Horizon Texture Modifier table.

## `site`

The Site table describes the locational information and characteristics
of a particular geographic location. A site may be a specific location
such as a point where a soil profile description is taken, or it may
have some spatial area that is chosen to be treated as a single point.
Various kinds of data such as soil profile descriptions, lab data,
vegetative data, etc. may be linked to a site in this database.

## `siteobs`

The Site Observation table records the date that the various observation
or analytical data is collected for the specific site or location. Soil

a site is revisited at a later date for additional data collection, a
new row with the appropriate date is entered in this table. Separate
tables exist for properties that may have multiple entries.
