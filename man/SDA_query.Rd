\title{Query Soil Data Access}
\usage{
SDA_query(q)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{A valid T-SQL query surrounded by double quotes}
}
\value{
a data.frame result (\code{NULL} if empty, try-error on error)
}
\description{
Submit a query to the Soil Data Access (SDA) REST/JSON web-service and return the results as a data.frame. There is a 100,000 record limit and 32Mb JSON serializer limit, per query. Queries should contain a WHERE statement or JOIN condition to limit the number of rows affected / returned. Consider wrapping calls to \code{SDA_query} in a function that can iterate over logical chunks (e.g. areasymbol, mukey, cokey, etc.). The function \code{makeChunks} can help with such iteration.
}
\details{
The SDA website can be found at \url{https://sdmdataaccess.nrcs.usda.gov} and query examples can be found at \url{https://sdmdataaccess.nrcs.usda.gov/QueryHelp.aspx}. A library of query examples can be found at \url{https://nasis.sc.egov.usda.gov/NasisReportsWebSite/limsreport.aspx?report_name=SDA-SQL_Library_Home}.

SSURGO (detailed soil survey) and STATSGO (generalized soil survey) data are stored together within SDA. This means that queries that don't specify an area symbol may result in a mixture of SSURGO and STATSGO records. See the examples below and the \href{http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/SDA-tutorial.html}{SDA Tutorial} for details.
}
\note{
This function requires the \code{httr}, \code{jsonlite}, and \code{XML} packages
