\title{Fetch Official Series Descriptions and summaries from SoilWeb API}
\usage{
fetchOSD(soils, colorState = "moist", extended = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{soils}{a character vector of named soil series; case-insensitive}

\item{colorState}{color state for horizon soil color visualization: "moist" or "dry"}

\item{extended}{if \code{TRUE} additional soil series summary data are returned, see details}
}
\value{
a \code{SoilProfileCollection} object containing basic soil morphology and taxonomic information.
}
\description{
This function fetches a variety of data associated with named soil series, extracted from the USDA-NRCS Official Series Description text files and detailed soil survey (SSURGO). These data are periodically updated and made available via SoilWeb.

The standard set of "site" and "horizon" data are returned as a \code{SoilProfileCollection} object (\code{extended=FALSE}. The "extended" suite of summary data can be requested by setting \code{extended=TRUE}. The resulting object will be a \code{list} with the following elements:)

\describe{
\item{SPC}{\code{SoilProfileCollection} containing standards "site" and "horizon" data}
\item{competing}{competing soil series from the SC database snapshot}
\item{geog_assoc_soils}{geographically associated soils, extracted from named section in the OSD}
\item{geomcomp}{empirical probabilities for geomorphic component, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{hillpos}{empirical probabilities for hillslope position, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{mtnpos}{empirical probabilities for mountain slope position, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{terrace}{empirical probabilities for river terrace position, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{flats}{empirical probabilities for flat landscapes, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{pmkind}{empirical probabilities for parent material kind, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{pmorigin}{empirical probabilities for parent material origin, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{mlra}{empirical MLRA membership values, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{climate}{experimental climate summaries from PRISM stack}
\item{metadata}{metadata associated with SoilWeb cached summaries}
}

When using \code{extended=TRUE}, there are a couple of scenarios in which series morphology contained in \code{SPC} do not fully match records in the associated series summaries (e.g. \code{competing}).

\describe{

\item{1. A query for soil series that exist entirely outside of CONUS (e.g. PALAU).}{ - Climate summaries are empty \code{data.frames} because these summaries are currently generated from PRISM. We are working on a solution.}

\item{2. A query for data within CONUS, but OSD morphology missing due to parsing error (e.g. formatting, typos).}{ - Extended summaries are present but morphology missing from \code{SPC}. A warning is issued.}

\item{3. A query for multiple soil series, with one more more listed as "inactive" (e.g. BREADSPRINGS).}{ - Extended summaries are present but morphology missing from \code{SPC}. A warning is issued.}

}

These last two cases are problematic for analysis that makes use of morphology and extended data, such as outlined in this tutorial on \href{https://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/competing-series.html}{competing soil series}.
