\title{Get Official Series Descriptions and summaries from SoilWeb API}
\usage{
fetchOSD(soils, colorState = "moist", extended = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{soils}{a character vector of named soil series; case-insensitive}

\item{colorState}{color state for horizon soil color visualization: "moist" or "dry"}

\item{extended}{if \code{TRUE} additional soil series summary data are returned, see details}
}
\value{
a \code{SoilProfileCollection} object containing basic soil morphology and taxonomic information.
}
\description{
This function fetches a variety of data associated with named soil series, extracted from the USDA-NRCS Official Series Description text files and detailed soil survey (SSURGO). These data are updated quarterly and made available via SoilWeb. Set \code{extended = TRUE} and see the \code{soilweb.metadata} list element for information on when the source data were last updated.

The standard set of "site" and "horizon" data are returned as a \code{SoilProfileCollection} object (\code{extended = FALSE}). The "extended" suite of summary data can be requested by setting \code{extended = TRUE}. The resulting object will be a \code{list} with the following elements:

\describe{
\item{SPC}{\code{SoilProfileCollection} containing standards "site" and "horizon" data}
\item{competing}{competing soil series from the SC database snapshot}
\item{geog_assoc_soils}{geographically associated soils, extracted from named section in the OSD}
\item{geomcomp}{empirical probabilities for geomorphic component, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{hillpos}{empirical probabilities for hillslope position, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{mtnpos}{empirical probabilities for mountain slope position, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{terrace}{empirical probabilities for river terrace position, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{flats}{empirical probabilities for flat landscapes, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}

\item{shape_across}{empirical probabilities for surface shape (across-slope) from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{shape_down}{empirical probabilities for surface shape (down-slope) from the current SSURGO snapshot}

\item{pmkind}{empirical probabilities for parent material kind, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{pmorigin}{empirical probabilities for parent material origin, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{mlra}{empirical MLRA membership values, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}
\item{ecoclassid}{area cross-tabulation of ecoclassid by soil series name, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot, major components only}
\item{climate}{climate summaries from PRISM stack (CONUS only)}

\item{NCCPI}{select quantiles of NCCPI and Irrigated NCCPI, derived from the current SSURGO snapshot}

\item{metadata}{metadata associated with SoilWeb cached summaries}
}

When using \code{extended = TRUE}, there are a couple of scenarios in which series morphology contained in \code{SPC} do not fully match records in the associated series summary tables (e.g. \code{competing}).

\describe{

\item{1. A query for soil series that exist entirely outside of CONUS (e.g. PALAU).}{ - Climate summaries are empty \code{data.frames} because these summaries are currently generated from PRISM. We are working on a solution that uses DAYMET.}

\item{2. A query for data within CONUS, but OSD morphology missing due to parsing error (e.g. formatting, typos).}{ - Extended summaries are present but morphology missing from \code{SPC}. A warning is issued.}

}

These last two cases are problematic for analysis that makes use of morphology and extended data, such as outlined in this tutorial on \href{https://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/competing-series.html}{competing soil series}.

Requests to the SoilWeb API are split into batches of 100 series names from \code{soils} via \code{\link[=makeChunks]{makeChunks()}}.
