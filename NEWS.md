# soilDB 2.6.11 (2022-01-04)
 * `get_SDA_property()` now works with mixed component and horizon-level properties; thanks to Matthieu Stigler for the bug report
 * `fetchSDA()` handle NULL component-level results with an informative error 
 * `fetchSDA()` now (again) returns mapunit/legend-level information via `get_mapunit_from_NASIS()`
 * `createStaticNASIS()` and queries to SQLite NASIS snapshots now preserve date/time using RSQLite 2.2.4+ via `extended_types=TRUE` argument to `dbConnect()`
  * `get_soilseries_from_NASIS()` now returns `soiltaxclasslastupdated` as a date/time and stores the year in calculated column `soiltaxclassyearlastupdated`
 * Added several tables to thematic groups in `get_NASIS_table_name_by_purpose()`
 * `fetchOSD()` gains surface shape proportions in extended `shape_across` and `shape_down` tables
 * `SDA_spatialQuery()` `what='mukey'` now works with `db='STATSGO'`
 * Added metadata to `loafercreek`, `gopheridge` and `mineralKing`
 * `waterYearDay()` pass through `format` argument for POSIX time conversion
 
# soilDB 2.6.10 (2021-12-14)
 * `waterDayYear()` and `.formatDates()` allow optional `format` and `tz` argument; used for consistent POSIX time conversion in tests where date/time has granularity finer than one day
 * `fetchSDA()` extensions for better handling of components with no horizon data
 * `SDA_spatialQuery()` and `processSDA_WKT()` fully use {sf}, replacing {sp} in these contexts
 * `SDA_spatialQuery()` gains argument `byFeature` to use multiple single-feature queries and combine the results with a unique feature ID specified by `idcol` argument. This allows for specific feature intersection results without secondary spatial overlay of the polygons (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/222)
 * `dbConnectNASIS()` no longer requires that the NASIS credentials option be set if the `dsn` argument is specified.
 * Rebuilt `loafercreek`, `gopheridge` and `mineralKing` from latest `fetchNASIS()` results.
 
# soilDB 2.6.9 (2021-12-02)
 * Replaced functionality using {plyr}/{reshape2} with {base}/{data.table}
 * `processSDA_WKT()`: replaced {rgeos} with {wk} and {sf}
 * `SDA_spatialQuery()`: added `query_string` argument
 * `get_SDA_property()`: fixes for MIN/MAX aggregation (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/219)
 * `get_component_from_SDA()`: fragment size thresholds now conform with new (clarified) NSSH definitions
 
# soilDB 2.6.8 (2021-11-05)
 * `fetchNASIS()` upgrades: use data.table and base internally for data aggregation
 * `fetchNASIS("components")` now "sieves" rock fragments and human artifacts using same routines as for pedons; respects `nullFragsAreZero` argument
 * `fetchKSSL(..., returnGeochemicalData = TRUE)` safely returns 0-length `data.frame` when no data available
 
# soilDB 2.6.7 (2021-10-27)
 * Removed several packages from Suggests: {gridExtra}, {ggplot2}, {viridisLite}, {mapview}, {rasterVis}
 * `get_OSD()`: Handle "NA" and type conversion for JSON results an convert spaces to underscores for file names as needed
 * `fetchSCAN()`: graceful handling of timeout and converted from {plyr} to {data.table}; (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/161, https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/184)
 * `get_EDIT_ecoclass_by_geoUnit()`: graceful handling of timeout 
 * `get_SDA_muaggatt()`: add `query_string` argument for parity with other "SSURGO on demand" / `get_SDA_*()` functions
 
# soilDB 2.6.6 (2021-09-24)
 * `get_SDA_pmgroupname()` and `get_SDA_hydric()` now support alternate aggregation methods. 
   * Default for `get_SDA_pmgroupname()` is `"dominant component"`, now also supports `"dominant condition"` and `"none"`. 
   * Default for `get_SDA_hydric()` is a map unit level aggregation of components and assigns new classes ; now supports `"dominant component"`, `"dominant condition"` and `"none"`

# soilDB 2.6.5 (2021-08-19)
 * API calls that return geometry in projected coordinates (AEA/NAD83) now use ESPG:5070 instead of EPSG:6350

# soilDB 2.6.4 (2021-08-06)
 * `fetchNASIS(from="pedons")` now supports `fill=TRUE` argument just like `from="components"` to include pedons that have no horizon records
 * `createStaticNASIS()`: column order should match NASIS, even if data types require reorder for ODBC driver
 * `fetchSoilGrids()` bug fixes, updates to metadata and references in documentation (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/201)
   * Corrected the conversion factor used for predicted `nitrogen` values (conversion from cg/kg to g/kg)
   * Corrected the conversion factor used for uncertainty in `bdod` and `nitrogen` (SoilGrids uncertainty layer always uses factor of 10 to create integers)
   * Improved error handling
   * Added `progress` and `verbose` arguments for text progress bar and additional message output
   * Added support for {sf} and {sp} POINT geometry inputs
 * Add `get_SDA_coecoclass()` SOD-style method for mapunit/component level summaries of ecological site and other vegetation class information
 
# soilDB 2.6.3 (2021-07-22)
 * `SDA_query()` and all functions that call `SDA_query()` get proper column class handling (related to #190), however:
   - be careful with the use of CAST(): unknown datatypes may not be correctly interpreted
   - previous column classes that were incorrectly guessed by `type.convert()` may have changed (e.g. `component.wei`)
 * `SDA_spatialQuery()` can now be used to return soil survey area symbols or geometry using `what="areasymbol"` or `what="sapolygon"`, respectively
 * Added new columns to soil classification ("SC") table result of `get_soilseries_from_NASIS()`; now including taxonomic mineralogy class which may contain multiple parts for series with strongly contrasting control sections
 * Updates to `get_SDA_*()` methods 
   - Extends `get_SDA_property(property = ...)` and `get_SDA_interpretation(rulename = ...)` vectorization over property/rulename to work with any aggregation method. 
     - Now supports: Dominant Condition, Min, Max, Dominant Component, Weighted Average
   - Add `query_string` argument (default: `FALSE`). Set as `TRUE` to skip submitting query to SDA, instead returning a string of the query that would have been sent instead of _data.frame_ result
   - `get_SDA_property`: better handling of NULL, miscellaneous areas, and property-specific weighting
     - Remove `ISNULL(x, 0)` logic that affected weighted averages in presence of missing data
     - Conditional calculation of horizon weights considering NULL values for requested properties (unique weights for each property)
     - New default argument `include_minors=FALSE` includes only components where `majcompflag = 'Yes'` in result
     - New default argument `miscellaneous_areas=FALSE` removes miscellaneous land types `compkind` values from result
     - Organic and bedrock layers are no longer removed from "Weighted Average", "MIN" or "MAX" aggregations
   - `get_SDA_interpretation`: added argument not_rated_value with default value of `NA` to set "not rated"" values across methods/queries. For backwards compatibility with original SQL use `not_rated_value = 99.0`
   - Standardizing MUKEY column name (and other keys) as lowercase in results 
   - More informative error messages for bad input / arguments inconsistent with specified method
 * Thanks to @hammerly who pointed out weighted averaging of NASIS `phlabresults` wasn't working as expected and for highlighting some more improvements (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/192)
 * `get_OSD()` TXT and HTML formats now supported (in addition to JSON) through a common function interface
 * Added `get_NASIS_table_key_by_name()` `get_NASIS_fkey_by_name()`, `get_NASIS_pkeyref_by_name()`, `get_NASIS_pkey_by_name()`, `get_NASIS_table_name_by_purpose()` methods for helping get information on primary/foreign keys and thematic groups of NASIS tables (useful for creating SQLite/external snapshots of NASIS tables)
 * `get_mapunit_from_NASIS()`, `get_legend_from_NASIS()` and `get_lmuaoverlap_from_NASIS()` now works for "MLRA Survey Area" `areatypename` and no longer is limited by constraints on `legendsuituse` or `mustatus`
 
# soilDB 2.6.2 (2021-05-14)
 *  Added `formativeElement` argument to `taxaExtent()` (SoilWeb taxon extent function)
    - "Formative elements" are derived from the dictionary provided by the {SoilTaxonomy} package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=SoilTaxonomy)
    - For example: `taxaExtent("abruptic", level = 'subgroup', formativeElement = TRUE)` will get an 800m grid (for SSURGO data in CONUS) showing extent of taxa that have "abruptic" in subgroup-level taxon name
 * `fetchNASIS(from="pedons")` result now contains the `"taxclname"` (full family-level taxon name) field from the NASIS `pedon` table; this value is calculated based on contents of `petaxhistory` child table
 * `get_SDA_interpretation` and `get_SDA_property` now support aggregation `method="NONE"` allowing for returning properties, classes and ratings for individual components or horizons (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/pull/181)
 * `ISSR800.wcs` and `mukey.wcs` now return a result that inherits from `try-error` (and a message) if the Web Coverage Service query fails

# soilDB 2.6.1 (2021-04-07)
 * Connections to local NASIS and various MS Access databases now use `DBI` and `odbc`, replacing `RODBC`
 * New methods `dbConnectNASIS` and `dbQueryNASIS` for NASIS access with read-only credentials, fetching query results, and closing the _DBIConnection_ upon completion
 * NASIS methods use `dsn` argument to specify a local "static" SQLite file containing NASIS tables, or custom _DBIConnection_ to a database with NASIS schema
   * Default `dsn = NULL` uses `"nasis_local"` [ODBC connection](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/setup_local_nasis.html) to local NASIS SQL Server 
 * Horizon depth logic checking is now done with `aqp::checkHzDepthLogic()`, powered by {data.table}
 * Added several new SDA query methods based on https://github.com/ncss-tech/ssurgoOnDemand by @jneme910 and @cferguso:
   * `get_SDA_property`, `get_SDA_interpretation`, `get_SDA_muaggatt`, `get_SDA_hydric`, `get_SDA_pmgroupname`
   
# soilDB 2.6.0 (2021-02-18)
 * `OSDquery` gets a new argument (`everything`) for searching the entire document
 * `fetchNASIS(..., rmHzErrors=TRUE)` -- spurious removals of data due to missing "extended" records. `fetchNASIS` now uses `aqp::horizons<-` after building a minimal `SoilProfileCollection` from NASIS site and horizon tables. This allows `aqp` integrity methods to trigger where needed--preventing unintentional re-ordering or removals of "valid" horizon data.

# soilDB 2.5.9 (2021-01-26)
 * `HenryTimeLine` moved to {sharpshootR} package
 * new functions `mukey.wcs()` and `ISSR800.wcs()` for hitting web coverage service (WCS) for gSSURGO, gNATSGO, and ISSR-800 grids
 * new function `ROSETTA()` for accessing the new ROSETTA model API (c/o Todd Skaggs, USDA-ARS)
 * `fetchOSD(..., extended=TRUE)` gains geographically associated soils, parsed from OSD (thanks AGB)
 * `fetchSDA_spatial` now can return soil survey area polygons using `geom.src = "sapolygon"` with `x` as a vector of area symbols (`areasymbol`) or legend keys (`lkey`). For `sapolygon` results, the `method` and `add.field` arguments work the same as for `mupolygon`, only now both geometries can be returned with fields from the `legend` table.
 * `fetchSDA_spatial` now can return STATSGO `gsmmupolygon` geometry with `db = "STATSGO"`; these data are linked to `mapunit` and (national) `legend` just like `mupolygon`.
 
# soilDB 2.5.8 (2020-10-20)
 * `fetchNASIS` / `soilDB:::.rockFragmentSieve` now uses fragment RV, `soilDB:::.sieve` uses `<` operator (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/1)
 * `fetchKSSL(..., returnMorphologicData=TRUE)` now returns redoximorphic features by horizon
 * new function `taxaExtent` returns 800m gridded taxonomic grids for CONUS
 * `seriesExtent` can now return 800m gridded series extents for CONUS
 * `SDA_spatialQuery` can now retrieve SSURGO and STATSGO geometry c/o [dschlaep](https://github.com/dschlaep) (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/141)
 * new import: `data.table`; beginning to implement _data.table_-aware methods in _aqp_ and _soilDB_

   * updated functionality in fetchNASIS_component_data() pulls mapunit-level data as well as component-level data
   * Munsell 'value' is now returned from PedonPC/NASIS fetching functions

# soilDB 0.9 (2012-10-24)
   * added a surface fragment summary "surf_frag_summary" to the results of get_extended_data_from_NASIS()
      + note: this has not been ported to the related PedonPC queries
   * integrated surf_frag_summary data into data returned from fetchNASIS(), stored in @site
      + note: this has not been ported to the related PedonPC queries
   * minor bug-fix in horizon-level rock fragment summary SQL which previously mis-classified BD as ST in some, rare cases
      + note: this has not been ported to the related PedonPC queries

# soilDB 0.8-3 (2012-09-28)
   * site-level data: {elev, slope, aspect} are now named {elev_field, slope_field, aspect_field}

   * compatible with NASIS 6.2
   * bug fixes
   * taxhistory selection method is preserved in the results
   * 'taxonname' is used instead of 'sampled_as' / 'correlated_as, **seems to work, but needs further testing**

   * updating for PedonPC 5.0 and NASIS 6.2
      + site data contains the best-guessed corresponding row from the taxhistory table, based on:
		1) most recent record, or 2) record with the least amount of missing data
      + taxhistory data are now included in the output from get_extended_data_from_pedon_db()
   * package is now partially compatible with NASIS 6.2

   * queries standardized between NASIS/PedonPC
   * new fetchNASIS() function for 1-line access to local NASIS data
   * new sample data set 'loafercreek'

   * new wrapper function fetchPedonPC() for typical site/pedon/hz queries
   * new function getHzErrorsPedonPC() for ID-ing pedons with problem horizonation
   * NOTE: hz data queries will return 2 rows/hz (error) when multiple texture 
  classes are assigned to a single horizon- this is a bug, not a feature!
