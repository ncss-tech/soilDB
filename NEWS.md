# soilDB 2.6.2 (2021-05-14)
 *  Added `formativeElement` argument to `taxaExtent()` (SoilWeb taxon extent function)
    - "Formative elements" are derived from the dictionary provided by the {SoilTaxonomy} package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=SoilTaxonomy)
    - For example: `taxaExtent("abruptic", level = 'subgroup', formativeElement = TRUE)` will get an 800m grid (for SSURGO data in CONUS) showing extent of taxa that have "abruptic" in subgroup-level taxon name
 * `fetchNASIS(from="pedons")` result now contains the `"taxclname"` (full family-level taxon name) field from the NASIS `pedon` table; this value is calculated based on contents of `petaxhistory` child table
 * `get_SDA_interpretation` and `get_SDA_property` now support aggregation `method="NONE"` allowing for returning properties, classes and ratings for individual components or horizons (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/pull/181)
 * `ISSR800.wcs` and `mukey.wcs` now return a result that inherits from `try-error` (and a message) if the Web Coverage Service query fails

# soilDB 2.6.1 (2021-04-07)
 * Connections to local NASIS and various MS Access databases now use `DBI` and `odbc`, replacing `RODBC`
 * New methods `dbConnectNASIS` and `dbQueryNASIS` for NASIS access with read-only credentials, fetching query results, and closing the _DBIConnection_ upon completion
 * NASIS methods use `dsn` argument to specify a local "static" SQLite file containing NASIS tables, or custom _DBIConnection_ to a database with NASIS schema
   * Default `dsn = NULL` uses `"nasis_local"` [ODBC connection](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/setup_local_nasis.html) to local NASIS SQL Server 
 * Horizon depth logic checking is now done with `aqp::checkHzDepthLogic()`, powered by {data.table}
 * Added several new SDA query methods based on https://github.com/ncss-tech/ssurgoOnDemand by @jneme910 and @cferguso:
   * `get_SDA_property`, `get_SDA_interpretation`, `get_SDA_muaggatt`, `get_SDA_hydric`, `get_SDA_pmgroupname`
   
# soilDB 2.6.0 (2021-02-18)
 * `OSDquery` gets a new argument (`everything`) for searching the entire document
 * `fetchNASIS(..., rmHzErrors=TRUE)` -- spurious removals of data due to missing "extended" records. `fetchNASIS` now uses `aqp::horizons<-` after building a minimal `SoilProfileCollection` from NASIS site and horizon tables. This allows `aqp` integrity methods to trigger where needed--preventing unintentional re-ordering or removals of "valid" horizon data.

# soilDB 2.5.9 (2021-01-26)
 * `HenryTimeLine` moved to {sharpshootR} package
 * new functions `mukey.wcs()` and `ISSR800.wcs()` for hitting web coverage service (WCS) for gSSURGO, gNATSGO, and ISSR-800 grids
 * new function `ROSETTA()` for accessing the new ROSETTA model API (c/o Todd Skaggs, USDA-ARS)
 * `fetchOSD(..., extended=TRUE)` gains geographically associated soils, parsed from OSD (thanks AGB)
 * `fetchSDA_spatial` now can return soil survey area polygons using `geom.src = "sapolygon"` with `x` as a vector of area symbols (`areasymbol`) or legend keys (`lkey`). For `sapolygon` results, the `method` and `add.field` arguments work the same as for `mupolygon`, only now both geometries can be returned with fields from the `legend` table.
 * `fetchSDA_spatial` now can return STATSGO `gsmmupolygon` geometry with `db = "STATSGO"`; these data are linked to `mapunit` and (national) `legend` just like `mupolygon`.
 
# soilDB 2.5.8 (2020-10-20)
 * `fetchNASIS` / `soilDB:::.rockFragmentSieve` now uses fragment RV, `soilDB:::.sieve` uses `<` operator (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/1)
 * `fetchKSSL(..., returnMorphologicData=TRUE)` now returns redoximorphic features by horizon
 * new function `taxaExtent` returns 800m gridded taxonomic grids for CONUS
 * `seriesExtent` can now return 800m gridded series extents for CONUS
 * `SDA_spatialQuery` can now retrieve SSURGO and STATSGO geometry c/o [dschlaep](https://github.com/dschlaep) (https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB/issues/141)
 * new import: `data.table`; beginning to implement _data.table_-aware methods in _aqp_ and _soilDB_

# soilDB 2.5.7 (2020-09-03) 
 * add `fetchGDB` for querying tabular data from SSURGO/gNATSGO/STATSGO File Geodatabases

# soilDB 2.5 (2020-01-23)
  * CRAN release
  * `simplifyColorData` and `mix_and_clean_colors` always use CIELAB colorspace for weighted averages, and best-available metric for transformation to Munsell notation
  * `fetchSDA_spatial` - new fetch function that simplifies getting spatial data associated with a vector of `mukey` or `nationalmusym`. The function has options for customizing result attribute table and is designed to automatically use `makeChunks()` to prevent timeout on large queries.
