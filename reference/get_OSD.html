<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 3 REMARKS: 4/18/03, DTA. In 2003 version, moved the type location from Burke County, North Carolina to Halifax County, North Carolina. The former type location is located in the mesic part of MLRA 136. The 05/2006 revision removed MLRA 153B. RIC of Ap revised to allow silty clay loam texture.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 4 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon--the zone from 4 to 60 inches (Bw horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the soil, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches</span>
